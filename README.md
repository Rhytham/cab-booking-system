# cb-booking-system
This project is a simple simulation of how cab booking system works in real time if managed only with c++ programming language. I have used dijkshtra's algorithm to calculate  shortest path between source and destination, with each location represented by a point in graph.
To make it real time, I have used multi-threading to manage when a cab gets free and when it is occupied.
